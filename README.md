# cs61a

This is a record of my progress in course cs61a taught at Berkeley during spring 2011 by Brian Harvey, based on the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". I am using Dr Racket and the SICP package which adds support for the langugage used in the book.

Goals:
 - do readings on sicp: http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/
