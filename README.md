# CS61A

This is a record of my progress for the course CS61A Spring 2011 which was taught at Berkeley by Brian Harvey, based on the book "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". I am using Dr Racket and the simply-scheme package which adds support for the langugage used in the book.

Select "Determine language from source" on the bottom left corner and add at the start of the code:
```
#lang racket
(require (planet dyoo/simply-scheme))
```
